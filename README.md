# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project focuses to summarize the key learning points in the prework assignment for the coding bootcamp.
The goal is to make a webpage with a concise guide as to what we've learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git!
This allows us to come back whenever we need a refresher to on these topics to a neatly organized page with all of our notes.
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:


## Table of Contents (Optional)

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

To get started make sure your computer is properly set up. We'll need to download Git, Chrome, VSCode, along with any files needed such as our image file used on this page. Once installed the most difficult part will be setting up the SSH key to allow our Git account on our computer to sync with the repository on GitHub.

## Usage

This page is to the benefit of anyone learning code and can be used to jumpstart what they already know. For example you can add a screenshot to your README file like so:

## Credits

Credits to the resources and guidance from the UCSD Extended Studies Bootcamp program.

## License

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

We've added our base HTML
Made it better to look at with CSS
Added JavaScript to make it interactive
And saved all our changes along the way with Git

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
